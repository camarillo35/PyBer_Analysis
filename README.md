# PyBer_Analysis
Project Purpose
PyBer_Analysis
Overview
The objective of this analysis is to get the relationships between the type of cities, the numbers of drivers and riders, and the percentage of fares from a ride-sharing app company. Two data sets are provided ride_data.csv with information of the fares from January to May of 2019 and the city_data.csv that show the type of city and the number of drivers.
To make a complete summary of the information, both datasets are merged and total rides, total drivers, total fares, the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver for each type of city are calculated. Lastly, multiple line graphs are created to visualize the total weekly fares for each city type.  
The goal of the project is to identify potential ways to improve access to ride-share services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods by analyzing how ride-share data differs by city type.

Software: Python 3.7.6, Anaconda, Conda, Jupyter-Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, GitBash 

Results
Total Rides by City Type - Urban cities have the greatest number of rides. The total number of rides for urban cities is approximately 13 times greater than rural cities and over 2 times greater than suburban cities.

Total Drivers by City Type - Urban cities have the greatest number of drivers. The total number of drivers for urban cities is over 30 times greater than rural cities and almost 5 times greater than suburban cities.

Total Fares by City Type - Urban cities have the highest total fares. Total fares generated in urban cities are 10 times greater than rural cities and 2 times greater than suburban cities.

Average Fare per Ride by City Type - The average fare per ride is highest in rural cities. Rural city average fare per ride is 12% greater than average fare per ride in suburban cities and 41% greater than the average fare per ride calculated for urban cities.

Average Fare per Driver by City Type - The average fare per driver is highest in rural cities. Rural city average fare per driver is 40% greater than average fare per ride in suburban cities and 3 times greater than the average fare per ride for urban cities.

Total Fares Over Time by City Type - Total fares analyzed by city type over time, from the beginning of January through the end of April. Tracking fares over time show that urban cities generated much higher revenue in fares compared to urban and rural cities.

Summary
Analysis of the rider-share data by city type shows that urban cities have both the highest access and best affordability for ride-sharing. In contrast, rural cities have the least access and the highest cost in average fares.
PyBer might consider bringing in more drivers to the rural communities since it is the area most underserve. 
Placing a cap on how much a fare may cost. This might make ride-sharing more affordable and therefore more attractive to potential users. Further analysis may be needed to verify that these measures are cost-effective, particularly if a cap is placed on fare costs. 
Make the customers aware of changes and create an incentive program. 
Further analysis may be needed to verify that these measures are cost-effective, particularly if a cap is placed on fare costs.
Obtaining more information about the demographics of those living in the three city types. For future analysis with demographic information such as population and age range, we can group the fares by age and city-type or by population and city type.
